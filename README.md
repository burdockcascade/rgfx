# RGFX

## Goals
- Fluent API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics
- Support for multiple backends (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, Metal)
- Easy integration with existing projects

## Non Goals
- Game engine features (physics, audio, etc.)
- High-level abstractions (scene graph, entity-component system)
- Platform-specific features (VR, AR, etc.)
